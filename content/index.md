# Welcome to The Dragon's Garden üêâ

Welcome to my digital garden ‚Äî a living collection of thoughts, research, and creative explorations on the body and its intertwining with philosophies, perceptions, expectations, effects on the mind and others. This space serves as both a personal knowledge repository and a window into the interdisciplinary work bridging creative practice with academic inquiry.

## About Kayla Lazrak

I am a Master of Fine Arts candidate at Northern Illinois University (expected graduation May 2027) with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (Summa Cum Laude, 3.92 GPA). My work explores the intersection of visual art, body image research, and digital humanities.

### Academic & Research Focus

My artistic practice centers on **body image research and embodied perspectives**, particularly investigating themes of identity, representation, and body politics through both creative and scholarly methods. This interdisciplinary approach positions artistic investigation as legitimate research inquiry, contributing unique perspectives to fields like psychology and anthropology.

**Research Interests:**
- Body image and embodiment theory
- Visual anthropology and ethnographic media
- Interdisciplinary transitions from fine arts to social sciences
- Creative practice as research methodology
- Material culture and identity formation

### Professional Experience

**Current Positions:**
- Graduate Assistant, Northern Illinois University (August 2024 - Present)
- Former Gallery Manager, Canary Gallery (July 2023 - July 2024)
- Former Gallery Assistant, UAB Art Lab (October 2021 - April 2022)

### Recent Exhibitions & Recognition

**2025 Exhibitions:**
- *Limited Palette*, The Kavanagh Gallery, St. Charles, IL
- *Blick Ars Nova Show*, Jack Olsen Gallery, Dekalb, IL (Juror: Olivia Zubko)
- *Unimposing yet Dignified*, George H. Gurler House, Dekalb, IL

## Research Philosophy: Art as Academic Inquiry

My approach transforms artistic practice into academic credentials through strategic positioning and methodological framing. Rather than abandoning creative work, I evolved it into new forms of knowledge production that contribute **invaluable embodied knowledge** to traditional academic frameworks.

Key strategic elements include:
- **Reframing artistic work using research language** while maintaining critical and creative essence
- **Targeting programs with faculty whose work genuinely connects** to interests in body politics and visual culture
- **Building bridges through additional preparation** in research methods and theoretical frameworks

This positions diverse creative backgrounds as strength while demonstrating thoughtful progression from arts to academic study, contributing valuable perspectives to expanding how academia understands embodiment, representation, and body politics in contemporary culture.
