**Pygmalion, or the Birth of Sculpture**
- "The visuality of painting can open up to the viewer only on the condition that the eye forgets the claims of the body" (13)
	- the illusion masques the reality that one is actually looking at a canvas/piece of paper. Sculpture avoids this, but not entirely. Michaelangelo's David, for example, if the eye forgets, is the depiction of a man, but it is still only marble. Still, it is closer to the body's perception of a man than a painting.
	- passage of ==Kenan's "Touching Sculpture"==
	
- "Viewer and sculpture partake of the same world or dimension" (13)

- "Sculptures are experienced through the possibility that they will enter and become active in our world...the viewer's body des not become seperated, taking instead an active role in imaginatively relating to them." (13)

**Herder, or the Aesthetics of Sculpture**
- ? "Aesthetics should enable us to recover the complex webs of experiences that inform our primitive concepts and to locate the origin of those concepts in our senses." (17) 
	- (Tentatively) Using aesthetics aids us in working through past experiences that have shaped our thoughts and perceptions. It also helps us find what exactly created those concepts in our minds.

- "Our knowledge of the world.... is fundamentally codetermined by our tactile knowledge of volume and mass, and by the kinesthetic experience of touching and manipulating bodies in the round." (17)

- "Sculpture is... a three dimensional body among other three dimensional bodies, eliciting a particular kind of response from the onlooker in terms of sensation."

**Classical Sculpture, or the Origin of Western Sculpture**

- Duality on depicting the body sculpturally (26)
	- weighed down by physical gravity, the stone it is made of
	- lifted up by the inner depiction - of hope, love, life
	
- The solitude of sculpture
	- "Sculpture is the form best adapted to expressing beings complete in themselves and balanced in all their moments"
	- self enclosed and self sufficient - it needs the viewer to be alive but it will exist independently.

**Sculpture as Theoretical Object

- "addresses essential characteristics of the medium of sculpture" (?) on Ray's Tractor
	- "Ray alludes to the importance of this distinction (outer appearance and inner essence) in understanding sculpture negatively by negating it radically. Instead, he proposes... the part-to-part relationship. For a tractor is built out of different parts which together constitute an object." (29)
	
- On armature: "The outer appearance of the sculpture works like an armour. The beholder is inclined to insert an imaginary dimension into that armour which one has no access to: passions, emotions, or just muscles." (30)
	- the touching of the wound of Christ by Thomas (to believe it was real)
	- basically, just showing a hollowed form invites/challenges viewers to imagine what is inside, how it is built
	
- ==Ray "How Many Sculptures Can You Fit into a Room?" (156)==
	- "Sculptures can be made in many forms from any material... Sculpture made from the physical world is a language written in three dimensions and read in the fourth dimension of time. But what is the sculptural text, where is it located, and what is its font? Is the space the page, and the physical sculpture a kind of font?"
	
- The size of a sculpture is always related to the size of oneself, or the human body. A meaning can be extrapolated from the size as well: big=important and small=unimportant. Or perhaps small asks for a more detailed look, while big demands attention.
