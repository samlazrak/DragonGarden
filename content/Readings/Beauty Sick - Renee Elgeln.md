**Beauty Sickness** describes the pervasive energy and effort that females divert to their appearance, which takes a toll on their cognitive resources, theirÂ self esteem, and often, their bank accounts, given how much money it takes to attempt to uphold the unattainable beauty standards of the modern age.

"The gender difference in the experience of one's body extends beyond simple satisfaction or dissatisfaction. When researchers... interviewed dozens of British men and women, they found that women tended to view their body in a fragmented way. They described their body parts as a series of disappointments, punctuated with rare parts that were 'just okay.' Most women seem to have a catalogue of appearance complaints at the ready. Stomach too wobbly, thigh gap nonexistent, skin uneven, hair not shiny enough. Each part stands on its own, ready to be picked apart." (29)

	viewing the body as a series of parts, each one with a different beauty score that either aid or hinder the beauty of the body as a whole. Rather than viewing hands as amazingly dextrous, able to create, gesture, write - as too wrinkly, nails that are the wrong shape, disturbing hair on the knuckles... regarding the body not for what it can do, but rather for how it can be seen.
