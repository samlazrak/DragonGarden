Merleau-Ponty's embodied consciousness: the body as primary site of knowing

The Lived Body: Merleau-Ponty distinguishes between the body as a physical object and the lived body. The lived body is the body as it's experienced internally, serving as the interactive medium through which individuals engage with the world.

Perception as Dialogue: Perception, for Merleau-Ponty, isn't simply receiving sensory data. Instead, it is an active, ongoing dialogue between the lived body and the world. This interaction constitutes meaning.

Rejection of Mind-Body Dualism: Merleau-Ponty's concept challenges the separation between mind and body. He argues that the mind is intertwined with the body, and our cognitive processes are shaped by embodied experience.

Primacy of Embodiment: The body is the primary site of knowing the world, rather than solely consciousness.
Habit and Understanding: Merleau-Ponty explores how habits embody a form of pre-reflexive understanding of the world. The body adapts and responds to environmental cues without conscious deliberation.
Challenging Traditional Philosophy: He criticizes empiricist and rationalist accounts of consciousness for failing to acknowledge the complexity of embodied experience and for presupposing a fully determinate, objective world.
